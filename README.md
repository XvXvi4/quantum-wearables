# Quantum Wearables Project

The Quantum Wearables Project integrates advanced quantum algorithms with real-world applications to enhance analysis, detection, and resource management.

## Features
- **Quantum Creation Algorithm**: Simulates particle creation in vacuum states based on energy fluctuations.
- **Water Property Analysis**: Extracts frequencies and calculates energy signatures of water samples.
- **Blood Property Analysis**: Extracts quantum signatures from blood samples for advanced diagnostics.
- **Security Intrusion Detection**: Identifies and mitigates suspicious activity in real-time.

## ERC1155 Smart Contract
This project also includes an ERC1155-based smart contract for managing Quantum Assets on the blockchain.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Solidity for smart contract deployment
- Install Python dependencies:
